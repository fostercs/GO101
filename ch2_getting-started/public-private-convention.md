In Go, the visibility of variables, constants, types, functions, and methods is determined by their capitalization. This is a fundamental part of the language's design and follows a simple rule:

- **Uppercase identifiers** (public): Identifiers that start with an uppercase letter are exported, meaning they are accessible from other packages. This makes them public.
- **Lowercase identifiers** (private): Identifiers that start with a lowercase letter are not exported, meaning they are only accessible within the same package. This makes them private.

### Examples

#### Public (exported) Identifiers

```go
package mypackage

// Public function
func PublicFunction() {
    // ...
}

// Public variable
var PublicVariable int

// Public struct
type PublicStruct struct {
    PublicField int
}
```

In another package, you can access these identifiers as follows:

```go
package main

import (
    "mypackage"
)

func main() {
    mypackage.PublicFunction()
    mypackage.PublicVariable = 10
    ps := mypackage.PublicStruct{}
    ps.PublicField = 20
}
```

#### Private (unexported) Identifiers

```go
package mypackage

// Private function
func privateFunction() {
    // ...
}

// Private variable
var privateVariable int

// Private struct
type privateStruct struct {
    privateField int
}
```

These private identifiers cannot be accessed from another package. Attempting to do so will result in a compilation error:

```go
package main

import (
    "mypackage"
)

func main() {
    // mypackage.privateFunction() // Compilation error
    // mypackage.privateVariable = 10 // Compilation error
    // ps := mypackage.privateStruct{} // Compilation error
    // ps.privateField = 20 // Compilation error
}
```

### Summary of Accessibility

- **Uppercase identifiers**:
  - Accessible from other packages.
  - Used when you want to expose something as part of your package's public API.
  
- **Lowercase identifiers**:
  - Not accessible from other packages.
  - Used to keep things internal to a package, ensuring encapsulation and hiding implementation details.

This convention simplifies the visibility rules and helps in maintaining a clean and clear codebase by explicitly defining what is meant to be accessible from outside the package.
